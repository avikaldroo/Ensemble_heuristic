# Ensemble_heuristic
This repository contains R script and python code for an algorithm to build an interpretable heuristic using prediction rules extracted from a trained Random forest model.
The file "final_R_script" contains the R script for extracting the prediction rules of Random forest model using "inTrees" package.
The file "executable.ipynb" contains the executable file for running the algorithm.

In the "executable.ipynb" file execute the blocks in the folowing sequence:

1. import the libraries and modules, run Code block 1
2. Run the R script after running the Code block 1
3. After running the R script run the code block 2,3,4,5 in the respective order.
